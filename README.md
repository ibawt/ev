Yet Another 2D C library

I didn't see many simple 2D C gaming libraries and I didn't want to use c++.

## Features
- sprite batching with all transformations done in a vertex shader
- raw old school C

## External Depenencies
- CMake
- a c/c++ compiler (C++ only for Box2D)
- SDL2.0 and SDLImage 2.0

## Included libraries
- jannson json library
- Box2D
- uthash
- gtest
- gmock
